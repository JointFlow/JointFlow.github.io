# Collaborators

The DFN Generator has been developed at the Danish Offshore Technology Centre, a research Centre at the Technical University of Denmark

## Michael Welch
Dr Michael Welch received his PhD in Earth Sciences from the University of Birmingham, UK, and is a structural geologist with more than 25 years experience. He previously worked for Rock Deformation Research and then Schlumberger, before joining the Danish Hydrocarbon Research and Technology Centre (now the Danish Offshore Technology Centre) in 2015. Since joining DOTC he has been developing methods of fracture prediction and modelling in the Danish North Sea chalk, for hydrocarbon flow modelling and CO2 sequestration.

## Mikael Lüthje
Dr Mikael Lüthje received his Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics and remote sensing from the Danish National Space Institute, Technical University of Denmark and the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge University in 2005. He has worked within the industry and applied research in U.K., Norway, and Denmark. He has been a Senior Researcher with the Technical University of Denmark since 2015. His research interests include prediction of fractures and faults for improved numerical flow modeling with a recent focus on CO2 sequestration and geothermal systems as well as remote sensing and deep learning for geophysical applications.

## Simon Oldfield
Dr Simon Oldfield is a Structural Geologist, Researcher and Educator with 14 years’ experience in applying geomechanics, seismic interpretation, reservoir modelling and geostatistics to projects ranging from the London Olympics to the Santos Basin.
